# YESOD is my personal Ethereum smart contract lab.

It is a living repository where I gather all the contract patterns that interest me in Web3, study them deeply, and improve them continuously over time — both in implementation and documentation.

This project is not meant to be “finished”.
It evolves as my understanding of Ethereum, Solidity, and the EVM improves.

# Philosophy

Learn by building: re-implement core patterns to understand their mechanics.

Iterate relentlessly: refactor contracts as better designs or invariants emerge.

Clarity over cleverness: code should communicate intent.

Explicit failure modes: custom errors, documented revert paths.

Assembly as a tool: used intentionally for learning or gas optimization, never to hide complexity.

The documentation style is inspired by Solmate and Solady:
minimal surface, sharp behavior, readable NatSpec.

# Disclaimer

This repository is primarily a learning and research lab.

While some contracts may be production-ready, others are:

incomplete

experimental

intentionally non-standard

Do not deploy blindly.
Audit, test, and understand before using anything in production.

# Contributions & Feedback

YESOD is personal, but external feedback is welcome.

Issues for bugs, edge cases, or unclear behavior

Suggestions for better patterns or documentation

Critical reviews are appreciated

The goal is improvement, not perfection.

# Meaning

Yesod (יְסוֹד) means foundation.

This repository represents my foundation in Ethereum smart contract design:
something solid enough to build on, but always open to refinement.
